abstract = {We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70\% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.},

abstract = {Modern program synthesizers are increasingly delivering on their promise of lightening the burden of programming by automatically generating code, but little research has addressed how we can make such systems learnable to all. In this work, we ask: What aspects of program synthesizers contribute to and detract from their learnability by novice programmers? We conducted a thematic analysis of 22 observations of novice programmers, during which novices worked with existing program synthesizers, then participated in semi-structured interviews. Our findings shed light on how their specific points in the synthesizer design space affect these tools’ learnability by novice programmers, including the type of specification the synthesizer requires, the method of invoking synthesis and receiving feedback, and the size of the specification. We also describe common misconceptions about what constitutes meaningful progress and useful specifications for the synthesizers, as well as participants’ common behaviors and strategies for using these tools. From this analysis, we offer a set of design opportunities to inform the design of future program synthesizers that strive to be learnable by novice programmers. This work serves as a first step toward understanding how we can make program synthesizers more learnable by novices, which opens up the possibility of using program synthesizers in educational settings as well as developer tooling oriented toward novice programmers.},

abstract = {AI code generators like OpenAI Codex have the potential to assist novice programmers by generating code from natural language descriptions, however, over-reliance might negatively impact learning and retention. To explore the implications that AI code generators have on introductory programming, we conducted a controlled experiment with 69 novices (ages 10-17). Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modification task. Our results show that using Codex significantly increased code-authoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual code-modification tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed significantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.},

abstract = {Errors in AI grading and feedback often have an intractable set of causes and are, by their nature, difficult to completely avoid. Since inaccurate feedback potentially harms learning, there is a need for designs and workflows that mitigate these harms. To better understand the mechanisms by which erroneous AI feedback impacts students’ learning, we conducted surveys and interviews that recorded students’ interactions with a short-answer AI autograder for “Explain in Plain English” code reading problems. Using causal modeling, we inferred the learning impacts of wrong answers marked as right (false positives, FPs) and right answers marked as wrong (false negatives, FNs). We further explored explanations for the learning impacts, including errors influencing participants’ engagement with feedback and assessments of their answers’ correctness, and participants’ prior performance in the class. FPs harmed learning in large part due to participants’ failures to detect the errors. This was due to participants not paying attention to the feedback after being marked as right, and an apparent bias against admitting one’s answer was wrong once marked right. On the other hand, FNs harmed learning only for survey participants, suggesting that interviewees’ greater behavioral and cognitive engagement protected them from learning harms. Based on these findings, we propose ways to help learners detect FPs and encourage deeper reflection on FNs to mitigate the learning harms of AI errors.},

abstract = {Over the past year (2022–2023), recently-released AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have gained significant attention from computing educators. Both researchers and practitioners have discovered that these tools can generate correct solutions to a variety of introductory programming assignments and accurately explain the contents of code. Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs. Our study findings capture a rare snapshot in time in early 2023 as computing instructors are just starting to form opinions about this fast-growing phenomenon but have not yet converged to any consensus about best practices. Using these findings as inspiration, we synthesized a diverse set of open research questions regarding how to develop, deploy, and evaluate AI coding tools for computing education.},

abstract = {Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life, many opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence. Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a specific area: responding to student programmers’ help requests. More specifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic code that students request help on. Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online programming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and GPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students’ code and assessed the LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently find at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90\% of the cases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57\% of the time). False positives are common (40\% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice that the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better on issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model solutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM responses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than responses to English prompts. Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in programming education. At the same time, the results highlight the unreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do, perhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment systems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future efforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.},

abstract = {The sudden popularity and availability of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT that can write compelling essays on any topic, code in various programming languages, and ace standardized tests across domains, raises questions about the sustainability of traditional assessment practices. To seize this opportunity for innovation in assessment practice, we conducted a survey to understand both the educators' and students' perspectives on the issue. We measure and compare attitudes of both stakeholders across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Responses from 389 students and 36 educators across two universities indicate moderate usage of generative AI, consensus for which types of assessments are most impacted, and concerns about academic integrity. Educators prefer adapted assessments that assume AI will be used and encourage critical thinking, but students' reaction is mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, higher-order thinking, and authentic applications.},

abstract = {Programming error messages (PEMs) are notoriously difficult for novice programmers to utilise. Many efforts have been made to enhance PEMs such that they are reworded to explain problems in terms that novices can understand. However, the effectiveness of these efforts to enhance PEMs has been weak or inconclusive. This work seeks to determine the role that code context has on programming error message enhancement. Erroneous Java code written by novices was sampled from the Blackbox Mini dataset. The erroneous code was presented to expert raters with four different PEM variants: javac (control), Decaf -- an error message enhancing IDE -- and two variants generated using GPT-4: one that enhanced just the javac error message alone, and one that incorporates the code context in the prompt. We find that providing code context to LLMs increases the likelihood of correct explanations for underlying errors, produces more specific fixes for erroneous programs, and produces fixes that are more likely to be correct. In large language models, the community now has a resource that is capable of taking code context into account, to the benefit of novice programmers.},

We also paid for an account so students could use the models for free without worrying about cost.In this experience report we analyze the outcomes. We see how students actually do and do not use the models. We codify the different uses they make.

abstract = {Programming skills are rapidly becoming essential for many educational paths and career opportunities. Yet, for many international students, the traditional approach to teaching introductory programming courses can be a significant challenge due to the complexities of the language, the lack of prior programming knowledge, and the language and cultural barriers. This study explores how large language models and gamification can scaffold coding learning and increase Chinese students’ sense of belonging in introductory programming courses. In this project, a gamification intelligent tutoring system was developed to adapt to Chinese international students’ learning needs and provides scaffolding to support their success in introductory computer programming courses. My research includes three studies: a formative study, a user study of an initial prototype, and a computer simulation study with a user study in progress. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through surveys, observations, focus group discussions and computer simulation. The preliminary findings suggest that GPT-3-enhanced gamification has great potential in scaffolding introductory programming learning by providing adaptive and personalised feedback, increasing students’ sense of belonging, and reducing their anxiety about learning programming.},

abstract = {Reasoning about code and explaining its purpose are fundamental skills for computer scientists. There has been extensive research in the field of computing education on the relationship between a student's ability to explain code and other skills such as writing and tracing code. In particular, the ability to describe at a high-level of abstraction how code will behave over all possible inputs correlates strongly with code writing skills. However, developing the expertise to comprehend and explain code accurately and succinctly is a challenge for many students. Existing pedagogical approaches that scaffold the ability to explain code, such as producing exemplar code explanations on demand, do not currently scale well to large classrooms. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) may offer a solution. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in generating explanations that can serve as examples to scaffold students' ability to understand and explain code. To evaluate LLM-created explanations, we compare them with explanations created by students in a large course (n ≈ 1000) with respect to accuracy, understandability and length. We find that LLM-created explanations, which can be produced automatically on demand, are rated as being significantly easier to understand and more accurate summaries of code than student-created explanations. We discuss the significance of this finding, and suggest how such models can be incorporated into introductory programming education.},

abstract = {We evaluated the capability of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), to pass assessments in introductory and intermediate Python programming courses at the postsecondary level. Discussions of potential uses (e.g., exercise generation, code explanation) and misuses (e.g., cheating) of this emerging technology in programming education have intensified, but to date there has not been a rigorous analysis of the models' capabilities in the realistic context of a full-fledged programming course with diverse set of assessment instruments. We evaluated GPT on three Python courses that employ assessments ranging from simple multiple-choice questions (no code involved) to complex programming projects with code bases distributed into multiple files (599 exercises overall). Further, we studied if and how successfully GPT models leverage feedback provided by an auto-grader. We found that the current models are not capable of passing the full spectrum of assessments typically involved in a Python programming course (<70\% on even entry-level modules). Yet, it is clear that a straightforward application of these easily accessible models could enable a learner to obtain a non-trivial portion of the overall available score (>55\%) in introductory and intermediate courses alike. While the models exhibit remarkable capabilities, including correcting solutions based on auto-grader's feedback, some limitations exist (e.g., poor handling of exercises requiring complex chains of reasoning steps). These findings can be leveraged by instructors wishing to adapt their assessments so that GPT becomes a valuable assistant for a learner as opposed to an end-to-end solution.},

Currently, discussions center around potential threats emerging from student's use of ChatGPT. For instance, generative AI will limit the usefulness of graded homework dramatically. However, there exist potential opportunities as well. For example, ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human language allows providing personalized feedback to students, and can thus accompany current software engineering education approaches. This paper highlights the potential for enhancing software engineering education. The availability of generative AI will improve the individualization of education approaches. In addition, we discuss the need to adapt software engineering curricula to the changed profiles of software engineers. Moreover, we point out why it is important to provide guidance for using generative AI and, thus, integrate it in courses rather than accepting the unsupervised use by students, which can negatively impact the students' learning.},

In this paper, we explore the capabilities of an LLM - OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide feedback for student written code. Specifically, we examine the feasibility of GPT-3 to check, critique and suggest changes to code written by learners in an online programming exam of an undergraduate Python programming course.We collected 1211 student code submissions from 7 questions asked in a programming exam, and provided the GPT-3 model with separate prompts to check, critique and provide suggestions on these submissions. We found that there was a high variability in the accuracy of the model's feedback for student submissions. Across questions, the range for accurately checking the correctness of the code was between 57\% to 79\%, between 41\% to 77\% for accurately critiquing code, and between 32\% and 93\% for suggesting appropriate changes to the code. We also found instances where the model generated incorrect and inconsistent feedback. These findings suggest that models like GPT-3 currently cannot be 'directly' used to provide feedback to students for programming assessments.},

abstract = {Understanding code is challenging, especially when working in new and complex development environments. Code comments and documentation can help, but are typically scarce or hard to navigate. Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the process of writing code. Can they do the same for helping understand it? In this study, we provide a first investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI built directly in the IDE that is geared towards code understanding. Our IDE plugin queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model with four high-level requests without the user having to write explicit prompts: to explain a highlighted section of code, provide details of API calls used in the code, explain key domain-specific terms, and provide usage examples for an API. The plugin also allows for open-ended prompts, which are automatically contextualized to the LLM with the program being edited. We evaluate this system in a user study with 32 participants, which confirms that using our plugin can aid task completion more than web search. We additionally provide a thorough analysis of the ways developers use, and perceive the usefulness of, our system, among others finding that the usage and benefits differ between students and professionals. We conclude that in-IDE prompt-less interaction with LLMs is a promising future direction for tool builders.},

abstract = {Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is prevalent in everyday life, with emerging technologies like AI companions, autonomous vehicles, and AI art tools poised to significantly transform the future. The development of AI curricula that shows people how AI works and what they can do with it is a powerful way to prepare everyone, and especially young learners, for an increasingly AI-driven world. Educators often employ robotic toolkits in the classroom to boost engagement and learning. However, these platforms are generally unsuitable for young learners and learners without programming expertise. Moreover, these platforms often serve as either programmable artifacts or pedagogical agents, rarely capitalizing on the opportunity to support students in both capacities. We designed Doodlebot, a mobile social robot for hands-on AI education to address these gaps. Doodlebot is an effective tool for exploring AI with grade school (K-12) students, promoting their understanding of AI concepts such as perception, representation, reasoning and generation. We begin by elaborating Doodlebot's design, highlighting its reliability, user-friendliness, and versatility. Then, we demonstrate Doodlebot's versatility through example curricula about AI character design, autonomous robotics, and generative AI accessible to young learners. Finally, we share the results of a preliminary user study with elementary school youth where we found that the physical Doodlebot platform was as effective and user-friendly as the virtual version. This work offers insights into designing interactive educational robots that can inform future AI curricula and tools.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial intelligence for teaching and learning in the academic sphere is a trending subject of interest in computing education. ChatGPT, as an AI-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened student involvement, cooperation, accessibility, and availability. This paper addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing ChatGPT as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate Computer Science curriculum in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. Students having completed the course work for a Data Structures and Algorithms (a sophomore-level course) participated in this study. Two groups of students were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. The control group (group A) had access to textbooks and notes of programming courses, however, no Internet access was provided. Group B students were given access to ChatGPT and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using Programming Contest Control (PC2) environment which is widely used in ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of students addresses the problem by writing executable code that satisfies a certain number of test cases. Student teams were scored based on their performance in terms of the number of successfully passed test cases. Results show that students using ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however, there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted code consequently affecting the overall performance. After a thorough analysis, the paper’s findings indicate that incorporating AI in higher education brings about various opportunities and challenges. Nonetheless, universities can efficiently manage these apprehensions by adopting a proactive and ethical stance toward the implementation of such tools.},

abstract = {Natural language processing has taken enormous steps during the last few years. The development of large language models and generative AI has elevated natural language processing to the level that it can output coherent and contextually relevant text for a given natural language prompt. ChatGPT is one incarnation of these steps, and its use in education is a rather new phenomenon. In this paper, we study students’ perception on ChatGPT during a computer science course. On the course, we integrated ChatGPT into Teams private discussion groups. In addition, all the students had freedom to employ ChatGPT and related technologies to help them in their coursework. The results show that the majority of students had at least tested AI-powered chatbots, and that students are using AI-powered chatbots for multiple tasks, e.g., debugging code, tutoring, and enhancing comprehension. The amount of positive implications of using ChatGPT takes over the negative implications, when the implications were considered from an understanding, learning and creativity perspective. Relatively many students reported reliability issues with the outputs and that the iterations with prompts might be necessary for satisfactory outputs. It is important to try to steer the usage of ChatGPT so that it complements students’ learning processes, but does not replace it.},

This is likely to have profound effects in the classroom, where novices learning to code can now use free tools to automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments. However, little is currently known about how novices interact with these tools in practice. We present the first study that observes students at the introductory level using one such code auto-generating tool, Github Copilot, on a typical introductory programming (CS1) assignment. Through observations and interviews we explore student perceptions of the benefits and pitfalls of this technology for learning, present new observed interaction patterns, and discuss cognitive and metacognitive difficulties faced by students. We consider design implications of these findings, specifically in terms of how tools like Copilot can better support and scaffold the novice programming experience.},

In pursuit of this goal, we have developed KOGI, a learning support system that integrates ChatGPT into the Jupyter environment. This paper demonstrates how KOGI enables students to receive timely advice from ChatGPT in response to errors and other questions they encounter.  

We immediately introduced KOGI in our two introductory courses: Algorithms and Data Science. The introduction of KOGI resulted in a significant decrease in the number of unresolved student errors. In addition, we report on student trends observed in the classroom regarding the type and frequency of help requested.

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically generative AI (GenAI) are threatening to fundamentally reshape computing and society. Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80\% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving.There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms.},

We assess existing error message enhancement strategies, as well as two novel approaches of our own: (1) generating error messages using OpenAI's GPT in real time and (2) constructing error messages that incorporate the course discussion forum. By examining students' direct responses to error messages, and their behavior throughout the course, we quantitatively evaluate the immediate and longer term efficacy of different error message types. We find that students using GPT generated error messages repeat an error 23.1\% less often in the subsequent attempt, and resolve an error in 34.8\% fewer additional attempts, compared to students using standard error messages. We also perform an analysis across various demographics to understand any disparities in the impact of different error message types. Our results find no significant difference in the effectiveness of GPT generated error messages for students from varying socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. Our findings underscore GPT generated error messages as the most helpful error message type, especially as a universally effective intervention across demographics.},

In this paper, we present our experience deploying a novel, real-time style feedback tool in Code in Place, a large-scale online CS1 course. Our tool is based on the latest breakthroughs in large-language models (LLMs) and was carefully designed to be safe and helpful for students. We used our Real-Time Style Feedback tool (RTSF) in a class with over 8,000 diverse students from across the globe and ran a randomized control trial to understand its benefits. We show that students who received style feedback in real-time were five times more likely to view and engage with their feedback compared to students who received delayed feedback. Moreover, those who viewed feedback were more likely to make significant style-related edits to their code, with over 79\% of these edits directly incorporating their feedback. We also discuss the practicality and dangers of LLM-based tools for feedback, investigating the quality of the feedback generated, LLM limitations, and techniques for consistency, standardization, and safeguarding against demographic bias, all of which are crucial for a tool utilized by students.},

As educators, we are just starting to grapple with the ramifications of this new technology, including implications for what we teach, how we teach, and how we grade. The decisions educators make moving forward depend heavily on the prevalence of students' use (and misuse) of ChatGPT in the classroom. Further, predictors of nefarious use could aid educators as well. We conducted an online survey to capture CS student awareness of, experience with, and attitudes toward ChatGPT. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that awareness of ChatGPT is generally high, and it is more frequently being used as a study tool than to complete students' work for them. Most students are aware of the potential for abuse in academic pursuits, but a notable minority of students admit to using it unscrupulously and to the potential for it to interfere with their learning. We conclude with a discussion of factors to consider as educators modify their approaches and develop guidelines for ChatGPT usage in their classrooms.},

abstract = {As the prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows in various sectors, their potential in education warrants exploration. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

Specifically, we evaluate various types of questions such as true/false, multi-choice, multi-select, short answer, long answer, design-based, and coding-related questions. Our evaluation highlights the potential consequences of students excessively relying on ChatGPT for the completion of assignments and exams, including self-sabotage.

abstract = {The emergence of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT poses unprecedented risks of new types of plagiarism and cheating where students use LLMs to solve exercises for them. Detecting this behavior will be a necessary component in introductory computer science (CS1) courses, and educators should be well-equipped with detection tools when the need arises. However, ChatGPT generates code non-deterministically, and thus, traditional similarity detectors might not suffice to detect AI-created code. In this work, we explore the affordances of Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection task. We used an openly available dataset of student programs for CS1 assignments and had ChatGPT generate code for the same assignments, and then evaluated the performance of both traditional machine learning models and Abstract Syntax Tree-based (AST-based) deep learning models in detecting ChatGPT code from student code submissions. Our results suggest that both traditional machine learning models and AST-based deep learning models are effective in identifying ChatGPT-generated code with accuracy above 90\%. Since the deployment of such models requires ML knowledge and resources that are not always accessible to instructors, we also explore the patterns detected by deep learning models that indicate possible ChatGPT code signatures, which instructors could possibly use to detect LLM-based cheating manually. We also explore whether explicitly asking ChatGPT to impersonate a novice programmer affects the code produced. We further discuss the potential applications of our proposed models for enhancing introductory computer science instruction.},

Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

We instructed GPT-4 to generate feedback for 113 submissions to four programming problems in an Algorithms and Data Structures class. We prompted the model with example feedback (few-shot learning) and instruction to (1) give feedback on conceptual understanding, syntax, and time complexity, and (2) suggest follow-up actions based on students' code or provide guiding questions. Overall, GPT-4 provided accurate feedback and successfully built on students' ideas in most submissions. Human evaluators (computer science instructors and tutors) rated GPT-4's hints as useful in guiding students' next steps. Model performance varied with programming problems but not submission quality. We reflect on where the model performed well and fell short, and discuss the potential of integrating LLM-generated, individualized feedback into computer science instruction.},

abstract = {Many instructors want to allow their students to use large language models (LLMs) in their introductory computer science courses, but they first want to see other instructors' results from doing so before taking on the risk in their own courses. Presented here are the results from allowing students to use LLMs in the second course in a sequence of intensive introductory courses designed to prepare students with a non-computational background for entry into a masters' degree program. We allowed students to use the internet and LLMs (such as ChatGPT or Github Copilot) to help with assignments, with guidelines to avoid plagiarism and encourage learning. We then surveyed students to ask about how they used LLMs, whether they saw others cheating, how they generally used internet-based resources on assignments and exams, and their feedback on the policies. We found that students are overwhelmingly using LLMs (and the internet generally) to learn and code "better" rather than cheat. These results are intended to be a starting point to spark discussion on the adoption of new technologies in introductory computer science courses. The authors themselves will continue teaching courses with the policy that students should interact with an LLM the way they interact with a person: students are encouraged to discuss and collaborate with it, but copying code from it is considered plagiarism.},

abstract = {When students in CS1 (Introductory Programming) write erroneous code, course staff can use automated tools to provide various types of helpful feedback. In this paper, we focus on syntactically correct student code containing logical errors. Tools that explain logical errors typically require course staff to invest greater effort than tools that detect such errors. To reduce this effort, prior work has investigated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 to generate explanations. Unfortunately, these explanations can be incomplete or incorrect, and therefore unhelpful if presented to students directly. Nevertheless, LLM-generated explanations may be of adequate quality for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to efficiently craft helpful explanations on their basis. We evaluate the quality of explanations generated by an LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) in two ways, for 30 buggy student solutions across ;code-writing problems. First, in a study with undergraduate TAs, we compare TA perception of LLM-generated and peer-generated explanation quality. TAs were unaware which explanations were LLM-generated, but they found them to be comparable in quality to peer-generated explanations. Second, we performed a detailed manual analysis of LLM-generated explanations for all ;buggy solutions. We found at least one incorrect statement in 15/30 explanations (50\%). However, in 28/30 cases (93\%), the LLM-generated explanation correctly identified at least one logical error. Our results suggest that for large CS1 courses, TAs with adequate training to detect erroneous statements may be able to extract value from such explanations.},

abstract = {With the immense interest in ChatGPT worldwide, education has seen a mix of both excitement and skepticism. To properly evaluate its impact on education, it is crucial to understand how far it can help students without prior knowledge answer assessment questions. This study aims to address this question as well as the impact of the question type. We conducted multiple experiments with computer engineering students (experiment group: n=41 to 56), who were asked to use ChatGPT to answer previous test questions before learning about the related topics. Their scores were then compared with the scores of previous-term students who answered the same questions in a quiz or exam setting (control group: n=24 to 61). The results showed a wide range of effect sizes, from -2.55 to 1.23, depending on the question type and content. The experiment group performed best answering code analysis and conceptual questions but struggled with code completion and questions that involved images. However, the performance in code generation tasks was inconsistent. Overall, the ChatGPT group’s answers lagged slightly behind the control group’s answers with an effect size of -0.16. We conclude that ChatGPT, at least in the field of this study, is not yet ready to rely on by students who do not have sufficient background to evaluate generated answers. We suggest that educators try using ChatGPT and educate students on effective questioning techniques and how to assess the generated responses. This study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.},

abstract = {Programming education can play an important role in cultivating students' higher-order thinking ability and enhancing the competitiveness of an intelligent society. However, a series of problems still exist: the lack of high-quality programming teachers, the low degree of personalization, and the insufficient learning interaction. This study constructs a novel programming learning model based on AI-generated content technology under the guidance of constructivism learning theory and cognitive load theory. The model divides programming learning into the process of learning program development, personalized context creation, learning chain of thought execution and practice exercises, and real-time interaction throughout the process. On this basis, the platform alleviates the shortage of teachers through intelligent programming assistants, realizes personalized programming learning through learning analytics and customized learning settings, as well as using real-time interaction throughout the whole process to change the status quo of insufficient interaction. Compared with traditional programming learning and practice methods, AIGC-based programming learning platforms can provide a more personalized learning experience and more timely learning interactions, which can effectively enhance learners' interest and learning quality.},

abstract = {As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain in popularity, it is important to understand how novice programmers use them and the effect they have on learning to code. We present the results of a thematic analysis on a data set from 33 learners, aged 10-17, as they independently learned Python by working on 45 code-authoring tasks with access to an AI Code Generator based on OpenAI Codex. We explore several important questions related to how learners used LLM-based AI code generators, and provide an analysis of the properties of the written prompts and the resulting AI generated code. Specifically, we explore (A) the context in which learners use Codex, (B) what learners are asking from Codex in terms of syntax and logic, (C) properties of prompts written by learners in terms of relation to task description, language, clarity, and prompt crafting patterns, (D) properties of the AI-generated code in terms of correctness, complexity, and accuracy, and (E) how learners utilize AI-generated code in terms of placement, verification, and manual modifications. Furthermore, our analysis reveals four distinct coding approaches when writing code with an AI code generator: AI Single Prompt, where learners prompted Codex once to generate the entire solution to a task; AI Step-by-Step, where learners divided the problem into parts and used Codex to generate each part; Hybrid, where learners wrote some of the code themselves and used Codex to generate others; and Manual coding, where learners wrote the code themselves. Our findings reveal consistently positive trends between learners’ utilization of the Hybrid coding approach and their post-test evaluation scores, while showing consistent negative trends between the AI Single Prompt and the post-test evaluation scores. Furthermore, we offer insights into novice learners’ use of AI code generators in a self-paced learning environment, highlighting signs of over-reliance, self-regulation, and opportunities for enhancing AI-assisted learning tools.},

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students’ usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.},

In this paper, we propose and explore the groundwork of a framework designed to combine these two applications of LLMs. The framework acts as a facilitator between the LLM and the student by reading the student’s prompts before filtering and modifying them and sending them to the LLM. The intent is that this will improve the responses from the LLM, thereby improving the student’s learning experience. We discuss the framework in detail and analyze the value of individual responses returned from the LLM as a result of our framework. We conclude that the framework causes the LLM to give helpful responses in comparison to how it would respond without the framework.},

abstract = {Help-seeking is a critical way that students learn new concepts, acquire new skills, and get unstuck when problem-solving in their computing courses. The recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers students a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it is unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources along dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing students now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected survey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our results suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have not yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources that students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors. Finally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with generative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate benefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We discuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing classrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.},

abstract = {Providing personalized assistance at scale is a long-standing challenge for computing educators, but a new generation of tools powered by large language models (LLMs) offers immense promise. Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students’ use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course;(n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools.},

abstract = {Worked examples, which illustrate the process for solving a problem step-by-step, are a well-established pedagogical technique that has been widely studied in computing classrooms. However, creating high-quality worked examples is very time-intensive for educators, and thus learners tend not to have access to a broad range of such examples. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), which appear capable of generating high-quality human-like content, may offer a solution. Separate strands of recent work have shown that LLMs can accurately generate code suitable for a novice audience, and that they can generate high-quality explanations of code. Therefore, LLMs may be well suited to creating a broad range of worked examples, overcoming the bottleneck of manual effort that is currently required. In this work, we present a novel tool, ‘WorkedGen’, which uses an LLM to generate interactive worked examples. We evaluate this tool with both an expert assessment of the content, and a user study involving students in a first-year Python programming course (n = ~400). We find that prompt chaining and one-shot learning are useful strategies for optimising the output of an LLM when producing worked examples. Our expert analysis suggests that LLMs generate clear explanations, and our classroom deployment revealed that students find the LLM-generated worked examples useful for their learning. We propose several avenues for future work, including investigating WorkedGen’s value in a range of programming languages, and with more complex questions suitable for more advanced courses.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have garnered significant attention in the academic community. Previous research has evaluated these LLMs for various applications such as generating programming exercises and solutions. However, these evaluations have predominantly been conducted by instructors and researchers, not considering the actual usage of LLMs by students. This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57\%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of ChatGPT amongst students. The findings from this investigation have broader implications and may be applicable to other LLMs and their role in computing education.},

abstract = {Large Language Models possess skills such as answering questions, writing essays or solving programming exercises. Since these models are easily accessible, researchers have investigated their capabilities and risks for programming education. This work explores how LLMs can contribute to programming education by supporting students with automated next-step hints. We investigate prompt practices that lead to effective next-step hints and use these insights to build our StAP-tutor. We evaluate this tutor by conducting an experiment with students, and performing expert assessments. Our findings show that most LLM-generated feedback messages describe one specific next step and are personalised to the student’s code and approach. However, the hints may contain misleading information and lack sufficient detail when students approach the end of the assignment. This work demonstrates the potential for LLM-generated feedback, but further research is required to explore its practical implementation.},

abstract = {Within the realm of teacher education, effective tools as support can enhance pre-service teachers' comprehension of STEM concepts and their ability to tackle with complex problems. This research aims to empirically investigate the impact of ChatGPT-supported collaborative learning on pre-service teachers' STEM teaching literacy, learning performance, and cognitive load. A total of 36 sophomore undergraduate pre-service teachers participated in an 8-week quasi-experimental study (with classes lasting 3 hours each week). These pre-service teachers were tasked with creating teaching aids and simulating instructional sessions. The experimental group engaged in small-group collaborative learning assisted by ChatGPT (N=21), while the control group (N=15) conducted conventional collaborative learning. The results indicate that pre-service teachers using ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance in terms of learning performance and cognitive load, though the improvement in STEM teaching literacy was not evident. However, ChatGPT contributed to students' acquisition and comprehension of STEM teaching knowledge. In essence, within a collaborative learning context, ChatGPT exhibits significant potential in addressing complex issues and offering personalized support but also we should mitigate potential risks. Collaborative learning with human-machine co-creation is poised to be a trend in the future of education, offering innovative avenues for the cultivation of STEM pre-service teachers.},

abstract = {Undergraduate computer science and software engineering students benefit significantly from in-depth reviews of their code early and often in their courses. Performing these reviews is time-consuming for teaching assistants and professors to complete, consequently impacting the timeliness and consistency of the provided feedback. When code feedback is not delivered close to the time of authorship, the utility of the review for students is diminished. Prior work with Automatic Static Analysis Tools has shown promise at using artificial intelligence to automate code reviews, with some success integrating them into classroom environments. To leverage new advances in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models, this work reports on an Automatic Review Tool (ART) to provide timely, automatically generated code reviews. ART was evaluated in a second-semester computer science course by integrating ART into the course's Github-based assignment submission system. A cohort of student volunteers (N = 74) read the ART reviews and provided feedback using a survey spanning two of their course assignments. The results of this pilot study show that students perceived ART was successful at detecting defects and offering style-based suggestions, and students were receptive to receiving future automated reviews of their work.},
